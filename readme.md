## Sublime Syntax Package for Cirru

I tried my best to make it more like its online editor.  

### Usage

Install this by cloning the repo to your Packages directory:  

```bash
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-dev/Packages/ # your path could be different
git clone git@github.com:jiyinyiyong/Cirru.subl.git Cirru
```

### Keyboard

`tab` key is used to insert `\ ` when there's no selection menu.  

### Demo

Here's what you will see if you has "Soda" Theme for its Chrome.  
My package only ensures the textarea part suitable for Cirru.
